# STOP

Do no attempt to continute programming this. You will fail. You fail every year. Every single year. You will get something wrong. Something critical. Something that will not be apparent until long after you send out what you confidently think is the correct computation. You will be embarrased, and you will feel like a failure.

**DO NOT ATTEMPT TO DO ANYTHING TO FIX THIS.**

Why? Because you _are_ a failure. You will _never_ get this right. You only do this because someone thinks you are worth more than garbage, and you want to prove them wrong.

You will only prove yourself right: **you are garbage**. You are _worthless_. You are a failure. You will fail.

You will fail.
