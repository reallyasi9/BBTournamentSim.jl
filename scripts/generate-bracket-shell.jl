"""
Standard scoring for NCAA brackets increases in powers of 2 per round such that the expected value of each game based on a coin flip picker is 1/2.

Standard scoring for B1G brackets is a choose-your-own-adventure where each game is assigned 1 to 13 points by the picker subject to the rules and no two games can be assigned the same point value and that the sum of point values assigned to a single round of the tournament add to no fewer than 5 points. The values presented here are typical given the game seeding and play-in rules.
